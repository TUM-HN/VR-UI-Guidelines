# FlUId: VR UI Design
FlUId is a VR application created to demonstrate good and bad user interface (UI) design practices in virtual reality. 
The project is based on design [Guidelines and Best Practices](../../wiki) and aims to provide an interactive, immersive way to experience the impact of UI design.

## Motivation
Designing effective user interfaces for VR is challenging due to the unique characteristics and opportunities of immersive environments. 
Many UI design principles taken from traditional desktop interfaces cannot be directly applied to VR as it introduces new factors that affect usability, comfort, accessibility, and immersion. 
FlUId was designed to provide a clear, side-by-side comparison of well-designed and poorly designed UI interfaces in VR and to help designers understand and apply VR-specific guidelines.

## Features
- Side-by-side comparison of good and bad UI implementations. Users can switch between the good and bad UI panels. Each panel demonstrates different approaches to layout, feedback, and interaction.
- A tutoral panel showcasing the good design principles, applied in the good UI design.
